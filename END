       The ssiimmppllee__sshheellll program is an interactive command interpreter, similar
       to bash or zsh.  It reads commands from user input,  parses  them,  and
       executes  them.  It supports basic command execution, handling of argu-
       ments, built-in commands, and path resolution.

       When started, ssiimmppllee__sshheellll displays a prompt, waiting for the  user  to
       type in commands.

       The following built-in commands are supported:


       eexxiitt [status]
              Exits the shell with the given status code. If no status is pro-
              vided, the shell exits with the status code 0.

       eennvv    Prints the current environment variables.

       ccdd [directory]
              Changes the current directory to the specified directory. If  no
              directory is provided, changes to the user's home directory.

              Other  commands  are  executed by searching the PATH environment
              variable and using fork, and execve.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       To start the shell:
       After the prompt is shown, type a command:
              ls -l
       or
              env
